### Hello! I'm Emrie, my passion is programming games, mathematics, and statistical algorithms!
I am currently a computer science student at the University of Houston. I'm self taught in OOP and Database Management, as well as how to create in depth algorithms and statistic managers for games.
I am the former owner of the Renatus Network minecraft server.
I love creating bots to automate things in my life.
- 🔥 The biggest project I'm working on is creating an integral calculator in python!
- 🔤 I am currently learning Computer Architecture and Discrete Mathematics.
- 🎮 My favorite video games are shooters and story games.
- 👨‍🏫 I am a top tutor at the University of Houston and tutor Data Structures and Mathematics!
- ✔️ Lastly, I am well established in SQL for database managment as well as Python, Java, and C++.
Thanks for checking me out!
