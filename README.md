### Hello! I'm Cameron, and while programming is my passion, Gits are a requirement!
I have taken 3 AP classes in computer science as well as being self taught in OOP and Database Management, as well as how to create in depth algorithms.
I currently work full time on a minecraft server known as Renatus Network.
I love creating bots to automate things in my life, and I have a passion for coding games!
- 🔥 The biggest project I'm working on is re designing the KitPvp gamemode for Renatus!
- 🔤 I have started focusing more on C++ as well as C#.
- 🎮 My favorite video games are Destiny 2, The Walking Dead by Telltale games, and Valorant.
- 👨‍🏫 I also tutor kids in python and keep all of my lessons as well as their projects here!
- ❌ I know to never to use global variables or abuse static methods unless it's the only option, don't worry.
- ✔️ Lastly, I am well established in SQL for data base managment as well as Python and Java.
Thanks for checking me out!

For java, I like OOP since to me, it's the most efficient.
